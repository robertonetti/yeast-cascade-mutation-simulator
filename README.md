# Yeast-Cascade-Mutation-Simulator
Yeast-Cascade-Mutation-Simulator simulates the duplication of a yeast cell up to a selected number of generations. The duplication process is accompanied by a cascade effect of mutations leading to a broad genomic spectrum at the end of cell growth.
### What was your motivation?
A single DNA damage event, such as a chromosome breakage in mitosis can be the cause of many mutational processes that occur as a cascade over numerous cell divisions. In addition, the process known as “adaptation to DNA damage” allows cell division despite DNA damages, probably provoking genome instability.
### Why did you build this project?
This project is designed to emulate the genome instability results obtained in experiments. Specifically, a single Wild Type yeast cell first suffers irreparable artificial DNA damage and then, through adaptation, begins to divide, producing the cascade effect of mutations mentioned above.
### What problem does it solve?
The further goal of the project is to build an algorithm that can reconstruct the history of the cascade process from the genomic spectrum resulting from the experiments. The role of the simulator will be to provide insights into the development of the algorithm and to test its capabilities.
